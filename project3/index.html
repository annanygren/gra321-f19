        <h3>A Quick Look at the Brandenburg Gate</h3>
    <p>The Brandenburg Gate was built between <b>1788</b> and<b> 1791</b>. It was created to be the key entry point to Berlin by Prussian King Frederick William II. The Gate is topped by a statue known as the <i>Quadriga</i>, which is a statue of the goddess of victory driving a chariot pulled by four horses.

        <h4>A Moment with Napoleon</h4>
        <p>
    The statue called Berlin home for a little over a decade before Napoleon Bonaparte and his Grand Army conquered the city in <b>1806</b>. He ordered the <i>Quadriga</i> to be dismantled and shipped to Paris. But after Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Waterloo (<b>1815</b>), the <i>Quadriga</i> was proudly reinstated on the Brandenburg Gate and from that point onward, became a <b>symbol of victory</b>; an iron cross/eagle were added to the laurel wreath.

        <h5>The Brandenburg Gate During WWII and Onward</h5>
        <p>
    The Gate was used as a Nazi party symbol as they rose to power. It endured severe damage during the war but was restored in <b>1957</b> which included recasting the <i>Quadriga</i> from original molds. Even after WWII the Brandenburg gate had negative associations. From <b>1961</b> to <b>1989</b>, it symbolized division since it shut off access to freely move from East to West.

    In <b>December 2000</b>, the Brandenburg Gate was privately refurbished at a whopping <i>6 Million Euros</i>!! On the 20th anniversary of the <i>Fall of the Wall</i>, the Brandenburg Gate became the main venue for the <b>Festival of Freedom</b>. Presently, the gate is closed to vehicle traffic and much of the surrounding area has turned into a pedestrian zone and popular venue for concerts/gatherings.
